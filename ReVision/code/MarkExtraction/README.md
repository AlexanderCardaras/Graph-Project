Mark extraction scripts
========

NOTE: This is research code in all senses of the phrase.

There are two main entry "binaries" to the system:
  * bar_finder_batch.m, and
  * pie_finder_batch.m

Both binaries take the following inputs:
  * path to a folder containing charts, and
  * path to a folder containing locations of extracted text, generated by ReVision's text extraction tool. By default, the scripts look for these text files in a 'text' subfolder in the charts folder. The text files should have the same names as their associated charts, with a '.txt' extension. They then output marks and data.

The input folder is determined by two variables:
  * "corpus_root", which is set in setupPath.m, and
  * "chart_path", which is set in either of the binaries.
The folder should contain a list of images. The scripts are hardcoded to recognize '.jpg', '.png', and '.gif' extensions.

The output folder path is set with the 'outpath' variable in each binary. The output will be as follows:

For bar_finder_batch.m, there will be the following files for each image:
  * A *_data.txt file containing the extracted mark locations and values,
  * A *_axes.txt file containing the axes locations,
  * Debug images for stages in the pipeline.

For pie_finder_batch.m, there will be the following files for each image:
  * A *_data.txt file containing the extracted slices and their values,
  * Debug images for stages in the pipeline.
